klaxon
======
klaxon is an alerting dashboard for [Graphite](http://graphite.wikidot.com/) written in [Go](|http://golang.org) and designed to run on [Google App Engine](https://developers.google.com/appengine/). Klaxon is modeled after the [Seyren](https://github.com/scobal/seyren) framework but provides multitenancy as well as authentication.

## Status
We are currently in development, we have skeleton servlet handlers setup as well as our data objects and we hope to have the rest only implementation done fairly soon. Following which we will concentrate on the user interface.
